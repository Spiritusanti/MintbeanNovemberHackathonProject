# Storybook - November Mintbean.io Hiring Hackathon Project

## Inspiration
This app was inspired by MadLibs but instead of writing in your own words you'll be drawing your own illustrations.

## For users
After reading the demo on the landing page, click the try for free button. This will take you to the StorybookApp where you'll be asked to select the story you want to follow.

Once you've selected the story it will load to a drawing canvas and give you the first story prompt for you to illustrate on the canvas. Once you've completed it click the save button on the bottom and it will load to the next prompt. Continue until youve finished all prompts.

After all your illustrations are done click the See the Result button to see the entire story with your drawings included! We do not currently have a download function but if you wish to share it we reccomend taking a screenshot.
